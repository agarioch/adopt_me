## Pet adoption site

Pet adoption site built while learning React. React code and API from https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v5/ with some changes e.g.:

- Added custom styling (practice TailwindCSS)
- Search inputs stored in context so they are not cleared when moving back & forth between search results and details
- Load sample results vs. 'not found' on initial page load
